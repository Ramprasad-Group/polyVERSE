The dataset comprises 8 columns:


1. **SN**: Serial Number
2. **Polymer_SMILES**: SMILES Representation of Polymer
3. **Solvent_SMILES**: SMILES Representation of Solvent
4. **Activities**: Experimental target Polymer-solvent diffusivity in log scale  
5. **log10(mmol_solvent/g_Polymer)**: Experimental Uptake sorption in log scale, where the solvent concentration is represented in milimoles and the polymer mass is represented in grams
6. **liquid_density_solvent**: Density of solvent in g/cc
7. **MW_rdkit*: Molecular weight of solvent calculated in g/mol
8. **log10MV**: Molar volume of solvent
