# ROMP and polyimide polymers generated via Virtual Forward Synthesis (VFS)

This directory contains the polymers generated in the companion paper. At a high level, commercially available molecules and known reaction rules (for ROMP and imide polycondensation) are used to generate plausible polymer repeat units.

<br>Link to the polyimides: https://github.com/Ramprasad-Group/polyverse-structures/tree/main/data

The code used to generate these structures is also publicly available at https://github.com/Ramprasad-Group/polyverse-structures.
