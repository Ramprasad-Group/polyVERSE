The data has been made available along with the following paper (to be published):

Schertzer, William; Al Otmi, Mohammed; Sampath, Janani; Lively, Ryan; Ramprasad, Rampid, "AI-Assisted Physics-Informed Predictions of Degradation Behavior of Polymeric Anion Exchange Membranes", The Journal of Physical Chemistry, Part B: Biophysics, Biomaterials, Liquids, Soft Matter, Section: B: Soft Matter, Fluid Interfaces, Colloids, Polymers, and Glassy Materials 

The dataset comprises 30 columns: 
* 1-3: **smilesx**: smiles of monomer x
* 4-6: **cx**: relative composition of smilesx in the copolymer
* 7-8: **solvent_x (M)**: molarity of solvent x used for alkaline stability testing
* 9-23: **addtive_x (wt%)**: wt% of additive x present in the sample
* 24: **RH (%)**: measurement relative humidity
* 25: **theor_IEC (meq/g)**: theoretical ion exchange capacity (IEC) calculated from the chemical structure
* 26: **stability_test_temp (C)**: temperature at which the stability test is conducted
* 27: **prop_test_temp (C)**: temperature at which the hydroxide conductivity is tested
* 28: **prop**: property name
* 29: **time (h)**: the ammount of time (in hours) elapsed since the begining of the alkaline stability test
* 30: **value**: recorded property value
