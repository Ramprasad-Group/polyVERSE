[An Informatics Approach for Designing Conducting Polymers](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c04017), ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 13, 53314-53322 (2021).

The dataset comprises 4 columns:

1. **SN**: Serial Number
2. **Polymer_SMILES**: SMILES Representation of Polymer
3. **Dopant_SMILES**: SMILES Representation of Solvent
4. **Electrical_conductivity**: log10 of the electrical conductivity of doped polymers in S/cm
