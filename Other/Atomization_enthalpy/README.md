The data has been made available along with the following paper:

Christopher Kuenneth & Rampi Ramprasad, [polyBERT: a chemical language model to enable fully machine-driven ultrafast polymer informatics](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39868-6), Nature Communications, 2023.

The dataset is in the following format:

1. **pol_id**: A unique pol_id assigned to each polymer within the database (PolyDB).
2. **value**: Atomization energy(eV/atom): DFT calculated
3. **hp_id**: A unique pol_id assigned to each homopolymer within the database (PolyDB).
4. **smiles1**: Polymer SMILES
5. **canonical_smiles**: canonical polymer SMILES
