The data has been made available along with the following paper:

Christopher Kuenneth & Rampi Ramprasad, [From Corpus to Innovation: Advancing Organic Solar Cell Design with Large Language Models](), submitted, 2025.

The dataset is in the following format:

1. **pol_id**: A unique pol_id assigned to each polymer within the database (PolyDB).
2. **value**: Atomization energy(eV/atom): DFT calculated
3. **hp_id**: A unique pol_id assigned to each homopolymer within the database (PolyDB).
4. **smiles1**: Polymer SMILES
5. **canonical_smiles**: canonical polymer SMILES
